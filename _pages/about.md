I'm Peiyi Jin (金沛宜 in Chinese). I'm a Ph.D. Student of the Department of Economics at National University of Singapore (NUS). I'm working with Prof. [Sumit Agarwal](https://www.ushakrisna.com/). Before this, I received my bachelor's degree from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE), China, 2020. I was an exchange student and RA at University of California, Berkeley (UCB), 2018-2019 and University of Jyväskylä, 2020.

I enjoy long cycling journeys to watch the landscape as well as collecting stories. In the past, it's super proud to me that I have done two long cycling journeys with my partners, which two are 1). Wuhan, Hubei -> Changsha, Hunan, 400km 2). Cycling Qinghai Lake, Qinghai, 400km.

I'm always planning to unlock more interesting cycling journeys. If you want to be with me, let's explore together.
