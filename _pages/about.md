<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

This study examines the link between tax-planning-induced illiquidity and credit risks in lending markets. Exploiting
an exogenous tax shock imposed on cryptocurrency gains and millions of transactions in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
lending, we document that tax-motivated borrowing strategies to defer capital gains taxes significantly reduce market
liquidity. This effect is pronounced among individuals borrowing in stablecoins (a way to monetize returns), those
with higher loan-to-value ratios (more risk-averse towards new regulations and typically with larger taxable gains), those
with high returns in the underlying asset (representing larger taxable gains), and those holding locked-in assets for over
a year (i.e., converting high short-term to lower long-term capital gains tax rates). Using instrumental variable analysis,
we provide a plausibly causal relation between tax-planning-induced illiquidity and increased credit risks. A standard
deviation increase in tax-induced illiquidity leads to a more than twofold increase in the value of defaulted loans. Our
results remain robust across a battery of checks, including analyses of subsamples of highly tax-sensitive borrowers, and
align with well-documented tax awareness periods. Overall, our insights are relevant to market participants, assist in
estimating revenue losses for tax authorities, and inform emerging policies on the tax treatment of digital assets.

   **Abstract:** This paper investigates the impact of privacy regulations on financial inclusion by analyzing a Google policy change that barred an Indian FinTech lender from accessing borrowers’ phone contacts. Previously, the lender used contacts as social collateral to reduce defaults. After the policy, application acceptance declined by 25.14%, while loan applications rose by 3.5%. Despite increased demand, default rates remained stable as lenders tightened selection criteria. This shift reduced lender revenues and disproportionately affected low-income, younger, credit-inexperienced, and lower-status borrowers. The findings highlight that privacy regulations, though addressing privacy concerns, can significantly hinder financial inclusion and lender profitability.
