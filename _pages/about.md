I'm Peiyi Jin (金沛宜). I'm a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at National University of Singapore (NUS), currently on the 2025–2026 academic job market. I'm working with Prof. [Sumit Agarwal](https://www.ushakrisna.com/). Before this, I received my bachelor's degree from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE), China, 2020. I was an exchange student and RA at University of California, Berkeley from 2018 to 2019.

[Consumption Not Less but Greener: Evidence from Residential Utility Digitalization](#), solo, *draft available upon request.*
<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>
<details>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  

This paper examines how real-time information feedback affects household consumption when price incentives are absent. Using a quasi-experimental rollout of digital devices providing real-time electricity data and remote shut-off via mobile apps, we find that treated households significantly reduce electricity use. Beyond energy savings, we observe broader spillovers: households shift diets from carbon-intensive to healthier food, substitute digital for paper use, and cut taxi rides. Our results contribute to the literature on behavioral nudges by showing that real-time digital feedback, unlike traditional static signals, can meaningfully influence consumption and promote greener lifestyles in the medium term.</p>

[Tax Planning, Illiquidity, and Credit Risks: Evidence from DeFi Lending](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4764605) with Lisa De Simone (UT Austin), Daniel Rabetti (NUS)

<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>

<details>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
 This study examines the link between tax-planning-induced illiquidity and credit risks in lending markets. Exploiting an exogenous tax shock imposed on cryptocurrency gains and millions of transactions in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending, we document that tax-motivated borrowing strategies to defer capital gains taxes significantly reduce market liquidity. This effect is pronounced among individuals borrowing in stablecoins (a way to monetize returns), those with higher loan-to-value ratios (more risk-averse towards new regulations and typically with larger taxable gains), those with high returns in the underlying asset (representing larger taxable gains), and those holding locked-in assets for over a year (i.e., converting high short-term to lower long-term capital gains tax rates). Using instrumental variable analysis, we provide a plausibly causal relation between tax-planning-induced illiquidity and increased credit risks. A standard deviation increase in tax-induced illiquidity leads to a more than twofold increase in the value of defaulted loans. Our results remain robust across a battery of checks, including analyses of subsamples of highly tax-sensitive borrowers, and align with well-documented tax awareness periods. Overall, our insights are relevant to market participants, assist in estimating revenue losses for tax authorities, and inform emerging policies on the tax treatment of digital assets. </p>

[Crypto Capture of Foreign Aid](#) with Sumit Agarwal (NUS), Eswar Prasad (Cornell), Daniel Rabetti (NUS) *draft available upon request*

<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>

<details>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
This paper investigates whether cryptocurrencies have become a new conduit for laundering diverted foreign aid. Using World Bank disbursement data from 2018 to 2024, linked with forensically tagged on-chain Bitcoin transactions and off-chain exchange activity, we document systematic surges in crypto transactions for anonymous wallets after disbursements, especially on exchanges located in tax haven jurisdictions. A one-standard-deviation increase in lagged aid is associated with a 0.51 log-point rise in anonymous transactions on tax haven exchanges—approximately a 66% increase—concentrated in newly created wallets and fading within two quarters. Network analysis reveals a real-time laundering pattern: funds flow through regulated platforms, then through mixers and tax haven exchanges, mirroring the classic placement, layering, and integration stages. Off-chain data confirm spikes in transactions on suspect, lightly regulated platforms. To address endogeneity in aid allocation, we use an IV strategy based on historical aid shares interacted with governance quality. Overall, our findings suggest that cryptocurrencies are increasingly used for offshore banking in concealing aid diversion. Our study shows how blockchain forensics can trace hidden financial flows and offers new tools for anti-corruption and crypto regulation.</p>

[Privacy and Financial Inclusion in Credit Markets: A Lenders’ Perspective](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QY0Ba49V9RbYpTz1cms9vca-3N3dRO-u/view)" with Sumit Agarwal (NUS), Pulak Ghosh (IIMB), Shohini Kundu (UCLA), Nishant Vats (WUSTL), Xinbo Wang (NUS, PhD Student) 
<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>
  <details>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
  This paper investigates the impact of privacy regulations on financial inclusion by analyzing a Google policy change that barred an Indian FinTech lender from accessing borrowers’ phone contacts. Previously, the lender used contacts as social collateral to reduce defaults. After the policy, application acceptance declined by 25.14%, while loan applications rose by 3.5%. Despite increased demand, default rates remained stable as lenders tightened selection criteria. This shift reduced lender revenues and disproportionately affected low-income, younger, credit-inexperienced, and lower-status borrowers. The findings highlight that privacy regulations, though addressing privacy concerns, can significantly hinder financial inclusion and lender profitability.</p>

[Credit Network and Data Sharing: An Evaluation of Cooperative Lending](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4463473) with Sumit Agarwal (NUS), Hsin-Tien Tsai (NUS)
<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>
<details>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
This paper examines the impact of credit data sharing among competitive banks of different sizes in open banking. Analyzing data from three predecessors of Bank of America, we find that information sharing enhances predictive capabilities and increases market lending profit as the network size grows. The bank sharing loans with varying collateral amounts contributes the most to improved prediction. However, competition leads to disparities in benefits, favoring smaller banks while the largest bank experiences losses in borrowers and profits. Effective bargaining for cooperative sharing is thus emphasized. We explore the Nash equilibrium for optimal outcomes in a competitive lending market.</p>

[Noncognitive Development and Peer Networks: Experimental Evidence on Chinese Rural Boarding School Students](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HpEJP17kEhlEo0Ir61jq8qqTzFLHL4Zf) with Yue Li (UCL, PhD Student)
<div style="margin-top:-20px;"></div>
<details>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
This paper evaluates the effects of audio bedtime stories on non-cognitive skill development among rural boarding school students in China. Using a randomized controlled trial across 63 schools, treated boarding students listened to stories via dormitory speakers, allowing identification of peer effects with untreated day students in the same classroom. Results show significant improvements in treated students, especially those with larger friendship networks, and spillover benefits for untreated peers connected to boarding friends. Early treatment boosts resilience. Employing a Linear-in-Means model, the study provides novel experimental evidence of non-cognitive skill transfer through peer networks, offering a scalable intervention impacting over four million children.</p>
